# SAINTS BOUND FOR HEAVEN

Our bondage, it shall end by and by;
From Egypt’s yoke set free,
Hail the glorious jubilee,
And to Canaan we’ll return by and by.

Our Deliv’rer, He shall come by and by;
And our sorrows have an end,
With our threescore years and ten,
And vast glory crown the day by and by.

Though our enemies are strong, we’ll go on;
Though our hearts dissolve with fear,
Lo, Sinai’s God is near,
While the fiery pillar moves, we’ll go on.
