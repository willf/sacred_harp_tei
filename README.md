# Sacred Harp in TEI

Mostly for learning TEI :)

Questions:

- Do we repeat title/author/composer in the metadata and in the text?
- Does having each song be a separate document make sense?
- How to say we normally don't want to attempt to syllable check choruses, but sometimes do?
- What to do about Lenox's meter, which includes the chorus
- Best practice for numbering?
- Better to use numeric meters, or names, or some entity?
